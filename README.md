# SkypeBlast (First Independent Project)

Automate messages to skype groups via a GUI using the Skpy API.
You can send messages in bulk to different groups at the same time.
You can also unsend messages, although it must be in the same session. (Can't exit the program and unsend as the data is stored in memory)
All groups IDs must be configured first. It is recommended to group clients by a shared attribute. 

To do:
Put the group IDs into a JSON file to avoid needing to recompile.
